    year: 1999,

      'A 7-level model of relationship health developed from 40+ years of longitudinal research observing 3,000+ couples. The levels build from cognitive knowledge of your partner up through shared meaning and culture.',
    keyInsight:
      'Successful relationships are built from the bottom up — you cannot create shared meaning without first establishing trust, fondness, and constructive conflict patterns.',

    description:
      'Four communication patterns — criticism, contempt, defensiveness, and stonewalling — identified as the most destructive behaviors in relationships. Their presence predicts divorce with 93.6% accuracy.',
    keyInsight:
      'Contempt is the single strongest predictor of divorce. It is the sulfuric acid of relationships. The antidote is building a culture of appreciation and fondness.',

    year: 2008,
    description:
      'ARE stands for Accessibility, Responsiveness, and Engagement — the three qualities that define a secure emotional bond. EFT is the most empirically validated approach to couples therapy, with 70-75% of couples moving from distress to recovery.',
    keyInsight:
      'Relationship distress is fundamentally an attachment crisis. When partners feel they cannot reach each other emotionally, they fall into negative cycles like pursue-withdraw.',

    year: 2000,
    description:
      'Attachment in adult relationships operates along two dimensions: anxiety (fear of rejection) and avoidance (discomfort with closeness). The combination determines your attachment style: secure, anxious, avoidant, or fearful.',

      'Attachment security is not fixed — it can shift through corrective emotional experiences in relationships. One secure relationship can reshape your entire attachment orientation.',

    year: 1988,
    description:
      'Intimacy is not a trait but a transactional process: Person A discloses → Person B responds with understanding, validation, and care → Person A feels understood. The process is bidirectional and builds on itself.',
    keyInsight:
      'Relationships die not from conflict but from failed intimacy processes — when partners stop disclosing or stop responding. Emotional disclosure, not just factual sharing, is what builds true closeness.',

      'Seven strategies that sustain relationships: positivity, understanding, self-disclosure, relationship talk, tasks, networks, and assurances. The best maintenance is when these behaviors become second nature.',

      'Routine maintenance behaviors (enacted without conscious effort) are more strongly associated with satisfaction than strategic ones. The best relationship care is habitual, not forced.',

      'Decades of research consistently show that perceived social support is the #1 factor associated with mental health outcomes — stronger than income, education, or even genetic factors.',
