// Moments engine — domain types + the injected capability seams.
//
// Moments are the EVOLVED daily check-in: momentary, EVENT-BASED affect capture
// (many per day, each with its own instant) replacing the one-per-calendar-day
// check-in. The store sits on the same three injected capabilities the check-in
// store used, so packages/shared stays dependency-free (CLAUDE.md: "No runtime
// dependencies") and the logic stays unit-testable without a device or real clock:
//
//   - Storage    — the key-value seam (mobile injects its MMKV adapter; tests
//                  inject an in-memory Map). Structural mirror of
//                  apps/mobile/lib/adapters/storage — never imported from the app.
//   - Clock      — a `() => Date` source. A moment's `timestamp` is the FULL instant
//                  at capture (not a calendar day): event-based, time matters. The
//                  day-rollup derives the local calendar day from it (dates.ts).
//   - IdFactory  — a UUID minter. The id is CLIENT-MINTED so the cloud push can
//                  upsert on the primary key for idempotency (re-push updates, not
//                  duplicates). Tests inject a deterministic counter.
//
// LOCAL-FIRST. The MMKV store is the source of truth; sync is a background, consent-
// gated backup + restore (ADR-001 / SR-4 carve-out — user-owned data, NOT telemetry).
